# Scraping-Challenge
This project involves scraping Mars-related data from sites and performing data analysis on the scraped information. The goal of the project is to analyze Mars news articles and create graphs to show findings on weather data.

Project Structure
The project consists of two main parts:

Part 1. Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
    - In this part, web scraping techniques were used to visit a Mars news site, extract titles and preview text from articles, and store the scraped data in Python dictionaries and a list. 

Part 2. Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
    - In this part, temperature data was scraped from a Mars Temperature Data Site, a DataFrame was created, data from the site was analyzed, and questions about Martian months were answered. A CSV file containing the data was collected from the site and created at the end of the code.
